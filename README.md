# BoomiTestbed

This is a groovy script testing tool designed to use with the Dell Boomi Platform. Testing scripts in Boomi can be time consuming and frustrating. This tool is a wrapper for the dataContext object and allows you to see the resulting document and its properties easily with out having to execute a process in the Boomi Platform.

### Prerequisites

You will need groovy set up and running to use this tool. Probably something like this will make it work.

```
packagemanager install groovy
```
